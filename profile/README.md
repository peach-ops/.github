# PEACH - Personal Environment for Advanced Cloud Hosting

Welcome to PEACH, my Personal Environment for Advanced Cloud Hosting.  
PEACH is the place where I deploy, manage, document everything related to my homelab.  
It encompasses the tools and resources I use, including OS images for my server, containers, Kubernetes manifests, etc.

## About PEACH

With PEACH, I'm bringing the concepts and experience of using a cloud provider to my homelab: pet vs cattle, immutable infrastructure, etc. The watchword is **reproducibility**.  

PEACH aims to provide simple and reproducible processes to build and operate my homelab infrastructure.
In the event of a disaster, I want to be able to quickly recover by re-deploying everything from scratch.

## Features

I use PEACH to:
- Manage my homelab as code
- Deploy and orchestrate containers with Kubernetes
- Document my projects
